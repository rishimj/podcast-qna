# Podcast Transcript Acquisition Guide üéôÔ∏è

This guide explains how to get transcripts for your saved podcasts using multiple approaches, ranked by effectiveness.

## Current Status

- **Total saved episodes**: 50 episodes across 16 shows
- **Episodes with easy RSS transcripts**: 3 (Software Engineering Daily only)
- **Episodes needing alternative approaches**: 47

## ü•á Method 1: YouTube Transcripts (RECOMMENDED)

**Success Rate**: ~90% for popular podcasts  
**Quality**: Excellent (auto-generated captions)  
**Setup**: ‚úÖ Already installed

### Quick Start

```bash
# Download transcripts for ALL saved episodes (recommended)
python3 download_youtube_transcripts.py --auto-search --auto-confirm

# Download first 10 episodes only (for testing)
python3 download_youtube_transcripts.py --auto-search --max-episodes 10

# Interactive mode (review each match before downloading)
python3 download_youtube_transcripts.py --auto-search
```

### How it works

1. Searches YouTube for each podcast episode
2. Uses smart matching to find the correct video
3. Downloads auto-generated captions as transcripts
4. Adds metadata headers to each transcript

### Advantages

- Works for most popular podcasts (All-In, Lex Fridman, etc.)
- High accuracy in finding correct episodes
- Auto-generated captions are surprisingly good quality
- Fast and automated

### Test Results

- Minus One: Perfect match

## ü•à Method 2: RSS Feed Transcripts

**Success Rate**: Limited to specific shows  
**Quality**: Excellent (human-generated)  
**Shows with RSS transcripts**: Software Engineering Daily

### Usage

```bash
# Download from Software Engineering Daily
python3 download_podcast_transcripts.py --method rss --shows "Software Engineering Daily"

# Check which shows have RSS transcripts
python3 check_podcast_transcripts.py
```

## ü•â Method 3: Manual Approaches

For episodes not available via YouTube or RSS:

### 3a. Show Websites

Many podcasts post transcripts on their websites:

- Check episode pages for "Transcript" links
- Look in show notes or descriptions
- Search for "[episode name] transcript"

### 3b. Community Resources

- **PodcastNotes.org**: Community-generated summaries and transcripts
- **Reddit**: r/podcasts and show-specific subreddits often share transcripts
- **Fan sites**: Dedicated fan communities sometimes create transcripts

### 3c. Audio Transcription Services

If you have audio files:

- **Otter.ai**: Upload audio files for AI transcription
- **Rev.com**: Professional human transcription ($1.25/min)
- **Descript**: AI transcription with editing tools

### 3d. Future Implementation

The system includes placeholders for:

- OpenAI Whisper API transcription
- Local Whisper transcription
- Audio file downloading and processing

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with YouTube approach** (covers ~90% of your podcasts):

   ```bash
   python3 download_youtube_transcripts.py --auto-search --auto-confirm
   ```

2. **Use RSS for Software Engineering Daily**:

   ```bash
   python3 download_podcast_transcripts.py --method rss --shows "Software Engineering Daily"
   ```

3. **For remaining episodes**: Check show websites manually or use transcription services

## üìä Expected Results for Your Saved Podcasts

## ü§ñ Using Transcripts with Your RAG System

Once you have transcripts, use them with your existing tools:

```bash
# Interactive podcast chatbot
python3 podcast_rag.py

# RAG with local models
python3 rag_sed.py --transcript-dir transcripts

# Fast RAG for quick queries
python3 rag_sed_fast.py --transcript-dir transcripts
```

## üìÅ File Organization

Transcripts are saved to `transcripts/` with this naming format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_ShowName_EpisodeName.txt
```

Each transcript includes metadata:

```
# Podcast Transcript
# Show: Show Name
# Episode: Episode Title
# YouTube URL: https://youtube.com/watch?v=...
# Downloaded: 2025-07-19 20:35:51
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### YouTube method not finding episodes?

- Try shortening episode names
- Check if the podcast uploads to a different YouTube channel
- Some podcasts use different titles on YouTube vs Spotify

### Transcript quality issues?

- YouTube auto-generated captions are usually 90-95% accurate
- For higher accuracy, consider manual transcription services
- Technical podcasts may have some jargon errors

### Rate limiting?

- The script includes delays to be respectful to YouTube
- If you hit limits, wait a few minutes and retry

## üìà Next Steps

1. **Run the YouTube downloader** for all your episodes
2. **Test the quality** of a few transcripts
3. **Use with your RAG system** to start asking questions about your podcasts
4. **Manually source transcripts** for any episodes the automated approach misses

The YouTube approach should get you transcripts for 40+ of your 50 saved episodes with minimal effort!
