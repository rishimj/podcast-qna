I have a very funny story to tell you.
Jason,
where have you been? I've been trying to
text you. You've been offline. What's
going on? Where have you been?
I've been working feverishly, but
yesterday I had to
go to prepare for some meetings that I
have on Sunday, which I can't tell you
about, but
Natt and I,
Natt and I went to Pasalaqua,
which is in Lake Ko, which is an in I
mean, it's stunning. The the grounds are
stunning. The hotel is stunning. if you
have a chance to go to Lake Ko.
Anyways, this is us at Pasal Aqua.
Who's the beautiful woman there? Is that
the woman who owns it or something? Is
that the queen?
That's not But the best part is we had
such a good time. You know how they have
like a registry book to leave a message?
Sure.
So, I left a message.
Here we go. What a truly magnificent
place. Above and beyond any expectation
we had.
Go below. Go below. That's not for me.
Thank you. We took everything. The free
We took everything. The free bird. Oh my
god, Jason. The hangers.
Okay.
The laundry bag toothpaste, the robes,
the slippers, everything.
Absolutely fantastic.
Listen, you're going to have to send a
bill to the free birds.
Absolutely.
[Music]
We'll let your winners ride.
[Music]
And that's it. We open sourced it to the
fans and they've just gone crazy with
love.
All right, listen. We've got a great
panel this week. It's the summer. Things
are slow. Some people are busy. I think
uh our prince of panic attacks, our dear
Sultan of science is uh he's at the beep
sax is busy. Couldn't make it this week
in his place. another brilliant PayPal
alumni and uh dare I say GOP supporter,
Heath Ra Boy. How are you, sir?
Pleasure to be with you again.
Nice to see you. And I'm assuming you're
in gorgeous Florida or somewhere in
Yeah,
I'm actually in New York.
Oh, my hometown. Is it safe? Is it okay?
Mom Dammy uh chasing you down the
street.
Not yet, but it's safe.
Seize your assets. It's safe. Yeah, it's
safe right now. We'll see you on
November 4th. You know, as you probably
heard, on July 4th was the first time in
recorded history that there were no
shootings or no murders in New York on
that day. So, right now, things are in
pretty good shape, but we may be maybe
leaving New York quickly.
Yeah, you're going to probably want to
sell that place if you got one there
because Mami is going to seize it and
turn it into a drugstore for you. Yes,
it's going to be
drug stores. Travis Kalanick is back
with us. How you doing, bestie?
Uh, pretty good. Pretty good. Yeah.
Second appearance here on the round
table and uh third time on the show. Of
course, you spoke at the summit. You've
been busy with cloud kitchens. Yeah.
Lots of exciting things going on.
Oh, lots of stuff. Lots of stuff. The
robots the robots are taking over. We're
we're rolling out. We're rolling out
robots. Yeah.
TK, can you tell us what you're doing
with this Pony AI thing or not? That's
speculation.
Uh look, you know, obviously is autonomy
as we, you know, in the US we have of
course. Wait, do you want to just frame
for people that don't that may not be up
to speed what was announced or at least
Why don't you frame it? So, why don't
you AI is um an autonomous company doing
self-driving? It's one of the few uh
players that actually have cars on the
road. They're based in China. They've
got a lot of operations in the Middle
East. They've got a deal with um a
delivery company called Uber, which you
might be familiar with.
Uh okay. So
look,
well the deal was basically that you
would partner with Uber, license in the
pony technology and essentially start a
competitor I guess to Whimo and Tesla.
Let me work on this one. Okay. So So in
the US we have Whimo. We see the Whimos
in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston,
coming soon to Miami, coming soon to
Atlanta, coming soon to DC. They're even
talking about New York.
Tesla's sort of like the, you know,
they're doing it the hard way, you know,
classic Elon style, like let's
let's do this sort of in a fundamental
holy [ __ ] let's go all the way kind of
kind of approach. Uh, and it's unclear
when it gets over the line. Of course,
he he launched sort of a a semi
semi-pilot of sorts in Austin recently,
but there's no other alternatives. So
what happens is is some of the folks who
are interested in making sure there are
alternatives
have reached out they they've reached
out to me and there different
discussions they get going because
they're like Travis you did autonomy way
back in the day got the Uber autonomous
stuff going in 2014
maybe there's something to do here to
create optionality now maybe like I'm of
course very interested on the food side
I talk about autonom onous burritos
being a big deal because if you can
automate the kitchen, the production of
food and then you can automate the sort
of logistics around food, you take huge
amount of costs out of the food out of
what's going on in food and that's of
course near and dear to my heart.
There's folks of course that want to see
autonomy and mobility. That's a real
thing. It it may be that or I would say
if you get the autonomy problem right,
you can use it to apply to both
problems. So there's a lot of folks
interested in
moving things, moving food, moving
people. And if there is some kind of
autonomous
technology that maybe I get involved in,
it might apply to a bunch of different
things. And so I've got some inbound.
Let's just put it that way. There's no
there's no real deal right now, but
there is definitely some inbound. And I
think there is some news about some of
that inbound that may or may not be
occurring. That's probably the best way
to put it. That is long-winded. I'll try
to tighten that up next time.
No, no, I think it's great to get the
overview here first on uh
allin. Thank you for sharing it with us.
And everybody knows you have
been doing a bowl builder lab 37 I think
it's called. We throw it up on the
screen. Not sure what the status of it
is. And then I'll let you go, Chimath,
with your follow-up question. But
I I think there's a pretty interesting
concept here of the bowl getting built
and then put into a self-driving car.
Now, that machine looks huge, but it's
actually 60 square feet.
That picture makes it look monstrous.
It's a 60 foot machine like uh imagine
running like a Sweet Green like brand or
a Chipotle like brand and just making it
so it comes to life for people who
who you know are like, "Hey, what is
this thing?" Imagine you just order
online exactly the kind of bowl you want
and actually this machine could run like
many brands at the same time and and
does you build the bowl you want
whatever ingredients uh it sort of it if
you look at that bottom you see those
little white bricks at the bottom that's
what carries the bowl underneath
dispensers it fills up the machine puts
a it sauces the the bowl then it puts a
lid on it takes the bowl puts it in a
bag uh puts utensils in the bag seals
the bag and the bag goes down a conveyor
belt where then another machine what we
would call an AGV takes the bull to the
front of house. The bull gets put into a
locker. The courier be a Door Dash who
breeds courier will wave their app in
front of a camera and it will open up
the locker that has the food that
they're supposed to pick up. So it just
it takes out a lot of what we would call
the the cost of assembly. um which is
more
reduces mistakes, right? I mean a
mistake. Yeah,
we know exactly how many grams of every
ingredient are put in. That's exactly
what you're supposed to get
and so you get a higher quality product.
It takes a lot of the cost out. You
imagine ultimately that's going to be
they're going to be couriers with that
as well that you know I like to say
autonomous burritos like is a Whimo
gonna carry a burrito or is Tesla going
to have a a machine that carries food or
you know is there another another
company that ends up doing you know sort
of the the the things the the the the
autonomous delivery of things and the
point is is well where we are right now
is we've got customers and so those
customers are starting to deploy
this quarter and it's pretty
interesting. I mean you can the in our
delivery kitchens
the cost of labor is about 30% of
revenue. That's what the successful guy
let's say 30% 35% of revenue in a in a
brickandmortar in a brick and mortar
restaurants it's even higher. Okay.
When they're running our machine it's
between seven and 10% of revenue.
Right.
Amazing. Then you take out the cost of
the delivery, you know, and now it's
becoming everybody can have a private
chef, which was your original vision for
Uber was people don't know the original
tagline, but it was your your p
everybody has a private driver.
Everyone's private driver was the
original for Uber. Basically, the
infrastructure was already there. And I
said this on, you know, one of your
recent, I think it was at the All-In
Summit, Jason, but like um
in the mobility, cars, you know, I
transport uh space, the roads were
already there. The cars were already
built. People weren't using their cars
98% of the day. So the infrastructure is
already there to get people around
to do this as a service and do it very
efficiently and conveniently
with food. The infrastructure is not
there. Like yes, restaurants have excess
capacity. That's what Uber Eatats
utilizes. But to go and say like let's
make 30% of all meals in a in a city uh
sort of prepared and delivered by a
service, the infrastructure is not
there. So you have to build it. So our
company that the mission is uh
infrastructure for better food. So
that's real estate, that's software and
robotics for the production and delivery
of food in this super efficient way.
All right. Uh Keith, what are your
thoughts? Any questions for
Well, he's not here, but isn't this what
David Freeberg tried to do a few years
ago?
Yeah. This came up on the last Allin.
Yeah. Or the last one I was at. Yeah.
Yeah. pizza. Pizza. The problem was I
told Freeberg, "People don't want to eat
quinoa.
You got to put a a little steak in
there, maybe a piece of salmon." But he
was kind of rel I think eventually he
relented and let people have a little
bit of protein. Uh but yeah, it's such a
great vision. And
wait, he he died as a vegan martyr.
I think the business died as martyr.
Well, that was the hill he was led to.
There's a lot of people have died on
that hill. But the bottom line is if
you're going to get into automation, you
have to it has to be endto-end
automation. And what I mean by that is
like there are pizza there are pizza
companies that have come and gone
automated pizza companies where it's
like we have a pizza machine and
everybody's like yeah this is amazing
and you have a guy you have a
million-dollar pizza machine and then on
the left you have a guy feeding
ingredients into the pizza machine and
on the right you have a guy taking the
pizza out and then putting it in a box
and doing all this. So instead of one
guy making pizzas, I have a
million-dollar machine and two guys
making pizza. And so when you look at
these auton like robotic food production
machines or food assembly machines, you
have to look at the full stack and say
does it work with the ecosystem that
exists in a restaurant and does it go
full stack from you know like like we
have this thing that machine we saw
earlier. The staff preps the food, they
put the food in the machine and then
they leave.
They're gone. This restaurant runs
itself for many hours without anybody
there.
But this could be McDonald's, Burger
King, and Taco Bell. Nobody would know
that right there. That machine is a it's
an assembly machine, right? The food is
prepped by humans and then assembled by
this machine. For a Chipotle or a sweet
green, this is like a a majority of
their labor, right? You go up to a
Chipotle, there's like 10 guys at lunch
and you're still in line. That machine
right there does 300 bulls an hour,
right? And so you go, okay, that's the
this is what's called um like the
assembly line. It's just that front line
where you basically assemble things. I
think sometimes I call it the make line.
What will happen over time is you'll
have perpendicular lines going into it
where you're producing food,
right? So you'll have a production or
bake line going into an assembly line
here and then you go, "Oh, wow." So you
have it something that dispenses burgers
on buns. That's the dispenser. That's
the assembly,
right?
But Factorio on steroids basically.
Yeah. And then it's like how do you cook
that burger? That's what I call that's
what we call state change. So state
change is the is the cooking of the
food. assembly is the like how do I put
it together and plate it.
Doesn't this collapse like for example
if you have a yield of 300 per hour you
said out of that one machine?
Yes.
Very quickly you can imputee the value
of having a smaller footprint store with
five of these things in a faceless
warehouse with drone delivery or cars.
You don't need the physical
infrastructure.
So then don't you create a wasteland of
real estate or how do you repurpose all
the real estate? Well, the way to think
about it is like 90% of well, it's
probably a little lower than that right
now. Let's say 85% of all meals in the
US are at home. They just are.
And a vast majority of those meals are
cooked at home. So, you know, like Uber
Eats and Door Dash, they represent like
1.8% or 2% of all meals right now. It's
very tiny, right? So what you're doing
is you're using real estate to and
infrastructure to prepare and deliver
meals to people at their homes. And so
it's not the restaurants still exist.
We're still going to want to go to
restaurants. We're still going to want
to go outside. We learned that during co
we knew it before. We definitely know it
after. Um and so I don't it's not really
like a decimating real estate situation.
It's taking a thing we used to do for
ourselves and creating a service that
does it higher quality. You know, sort
of I like to say you don't have to be
wealthy to be healthy
and just infrastructure to get that cost
down.
And so you're doing something as a
service that we used to do at home.
I think in the super long run you're
like what where's the story on grocery
stores? If you go to like in in 20
years, I think everybody agrees,
you you will have machines making very
high quality, very personalized meals
for everybody.
This will be good for Keith because he
measures stuff down to like five
calories based on his Instagram.
What's your What's your What's your body
fat? Like seven%.
It's like
Just open his Instagram. He posted four
times today about his body fat. like so
disgusted with himself at 10%.
It's like bad at 10. But um I actually
think the vision of this actually the
natural implication and maybe the home
run version of this is everybody has a
private chef in their house, a robot in
their house that actually does this
personalized because people do want to
cook at home, but they don't have the
time.
Yeah. Or space uh and infrastructure.
But man, these delivery services are
charging. Rich people do this all the
time, right? They do these crazy meal
delivery services for 200 bucks a day
and this is just going to abstract it
down to everybody and man people get
creative when there's that empty space
to your point Jimoth about what happens
to all this space. When I lived in New
York in the 80s and 90s it was common to
in Tribeca in West Chelsea where I lived
to take storefronts put your little
architect's office in the front and live
in the back. And many people were
hacking real estate. We still need five,
10 million homes in this country. And
they're already doing this with malls. I
I I keep seeing malls being turned into
colleges and creative spaces. One of
them in Boston, they turned like the
second and third floor into studio
apartments for artists. So, you know,
where there's a will, there's a way we
could use the space. I mean,
yeah. Where this goes, what Chimamas
saying and where the real estate goes is
we call it the internet food court
where, you know, you're on Amazon,
right? It's the everything store. Now
imagine that for food and then imagine
you have an 8,000 foot facility where
basically anything can be made.
Anything can be made
because if you have that machine you saw
has 18 sort of dispensers for food, 10
different sauces. You get the idea. Now
what what about when it's 50 or 100
dispensers for food? What if you have
multiple machines with a 100 dispensers
for food?
That's crazy. you can the combinatorial
math in terms of what's possible, what
can be made sort of, you know, goes
exponential and so
the internet food court is sort of the
vision for where this all goes.
Another example of the bitter lesson.
The bitter Yeah, we're going to get to
that, I guess, today
in a very full docket. Before we get to
that, just a little bit of housekeeping
here.
September 7th, 8th, 9th in Los Angeles,
the All-In Summit again, all-in.com yada
yada yada. The lineup is stacked and
we're gonna start announcing the
speakers. People have been begging us to
announce the speakers.
I don't know.
You got to hold some back. Careful,
careful.
Hold a couple back, but we got some
really nice speakers lined up. It is
going to be extraordinary.
It is. It is the best one yet.
I mean, every year we have this done.
Yeah. Yeah. Every year we have this
little bit of panic like um you know we
going to get great speakers and man they
started flowing in this week it's going
to be extraordinary
almost as extraordinary as this
delicious tequila behind my head here.
Get the allin tequila at
tequila.allin.com.
Deliveries begin late summer.
He's moving to the side. You can't even
tell
right there.
All right. Listen.
Oh wow.
Lots to discuss this week. Obviously AI
is continuing to be the big story in our
industry and for good reason. Our bestie
uh Elon released Gro 4 Wednesday night.
Two versions, base model and a heavy
model. 30 bucks a month for the base.
$300 a month for this heavy model which
has a very unique feature. You can have
a multi- aent feature. I got to see this
actually when I visited XAI a couple of
weeks ago where multiple agents work on
the same problem then they and they do
that simultaneously obviously and then
compare each other's work and it gives
you kind of like a study group the best
answer uh by consensus really
interesting according to artificial
analysis benchmarks you can pull that up
Nick Gro 4 base model has surpassed
OpenAI's 03 pro Google Gemini's 2.5 pro
as the most intelligent model
includes like seven different industry
standard evaluation tests. You can look
it up, but reasoning, math, coding, all
that kind of stuff. This is, you know,
book smarts, not necessarily street
smart. So, it doesn't mean that these
things can reason. And obviously there
was a little um there was a little
kurluffle on um X formerly known as
Twitter where XAI got a little frisky
and was saying all kinds of crazy stuff
and needed to uh maybe be redteamed a
little bit more decisively.
Many of you know Grock 4 was trained on
Colossus. That's that giant data center
that Elon's been building. And we showed
the chart here. Shimoth,
you sent us a link to the bitter lesson
by uh Rich Sutton in the group chat.
That's the 2019 blog post. We'll pull it
up here for people to take a look at and
we'll put it in the show notes. Maybe
just generally,
yeah,
your reaction to both how quickly Elon
has, and that chart showed it, how
quickly Elon has caught up
and I don't think people expected him to
take the lead, but here we are. Before
we start, Nick, can you please show
Elon's tweet about how they did on the
AGI benchmark? It's absolutely
incredible.
Two things. One is how quickly starting
in March of 2023, so we're talking about
less than 2 and 1/2 years, what this
team has accomplished
and how far ahead they are of everybody
else. that's demonstrated by this. But
the second is a fundamental
architectural decision that Elon made
which I think we didn't fully appreciate
until now. And it maps to an
architectural decision he made at Tesla
as well. And for all we know, we'll
figure out that he made an equivalent
decision at SpaceX. And that decision is
really well encapsulated by this essay,
the bitter lesson by Rich Sutton. And
Nick, if you can just throw this up
there, but just to summarize what this
says, it basically says in a nutshell
that you're always better off when
you're trying to solve an AI problem
taking a general learning approach that
can scale with computation because it
ultimately proves to be the most
effective. And the alternative would be
something that's much more human labored
and human involved that requires human
knowledge. And so the first method, what
it essentially allows you to do is view
any problem as an endless scalable
search or learning task. And as it's
turned out, whether it's chess or go or
speech recognition or computer vision,
whenever there was two competing
approaches, one that used general
computation and one that used human
knowledge, the general computation
problem always won. And so it creates
this bitter lesson for humans that want
to think that we are at the center of
all of this critical learning and all of
these leaps. In more AI specific
language, what it means is that a lot of
these systems create these embeddings
that are just not understandable by
humans at all, but it yields incredible
results.
So why is this crazy? Well, he made this
huge bet on this 100,000 GPU cluster.
People thought, "Wow, that's a lot. Is
it going to bear fruit?" Then he said,
"No, actually, I'm scaling it up to
250,000." Then he said, "It's going to
scale up to a million." And what these
results show is a general computational
approach that doesn't require as much
human labeling can actually get to the
answer and better answers faster. That
has huge implications because if you
think about all these other companies,
what is Llama been doing? They just
spent 15 billion to buy 49% of scale AI.
That's exactly a bet on human knowledge.
What is Gemini doing? What is OpenAI
doing? What is Anthropic doing? So all
these things come into question. And
then the last thing I'll say is if you
look back, he made this bet once before,
which was Tesla FSD versus Whimo. And
Tesla FSD only had cameras. It didn't
have LAR. But the bet was, I'll just
collect billions and billions of driving
miles before anybody else does and apply
general compute and it'll get to
autonomy faster than the other more
laborious and very expensive approach.
So I just think it's an incredible
moment in technology where we see so
many examples. Travis is another one
what he's just talked about. You know,
the bitter lesson is you could believe
that, you know, food is this immutable
thing that's made meticulously by hand
by these individuals, or you can take
this general purpose computer approach,
which is what he took, waited for these
cost curves to come into play, and now
you can scale food to every human on
Earth. I I just think it's a it's so
profoundly important.
One thing I'll throw out there, Chimoth,
is
the Tesla approach for autonomy is
taking human knowledge. In fact, the
whole idea is to approximate human human
driving, right? The is the whole damn
thing. Now, depending on your approach
in the technology, you can do like
what's called an end toend approach or
you can look at okay perception,
prediction, planning, uh, and control,
which are like these four modules that
sort of you you you sort of engineer if
that makes sense. But it's approximating
human driving to do it. The difference
is that,
you know, I I think Elon's taken a a
almost a more human approach, which is
like, I've got two eyes. Why can't my
car Why can't my car do it like a human?
Like, I don't have any LAR spinning
around on my head as a human. Why can't
my car? So, it's kind of interesting.
He's sort of taking what you're saying
Chimoth on the computation side because
hardware 5 is coming out on Tesla
probably next year
which is going to make a big difference
in what FSD can do.
That's the compute side you're talking
about. But then he is approximating
human.
Yeah. I just meant that, you know, other
than the first versions of FSD, which I
think Andre talked about, Andre Carpathy
talked about,
you know, they're not really so
reliant anymore on human labeling, per
se, right? So that that Yeah, that that
interference. And then
the other crazy thing that he said
subsequent versions of Grock
are not going to be trained on any
traditional data set that exists in the
wild. the cumulative sum of human
knowledge has been exhausted in AI
training. That happened basically last
last year. And so the only way to then
supplement that is with synthetic data
where the AI creates it'll sort of write
an essay or it'll come up with with a
thesis and then it will grade itself um
and and and sort of go through this
process of self-arning with synthetic
data. He said that he's going to have
agents creating synthetic data from
scratch that then drive all the training
which I just think is it's crazy.
Just explain this concept one more time
with a bitter lesson. hand coding
heristics into the computer and saying,
"Hey, here are specific openings in
chess."
Use Yeah, use chess, right?
You're hand coding specific examples of
openings in there, end games, etc.
versus just saying, "Play every possible
game, and here's every game we have."
So, here's
Yeah. So, the two approaches would be,
let's say, like Travis and I were
building competing versions of a chess
solver, and Travis's approach would say,
I'm just going to define the chessboard.
I'm gonna give the players certain
boundaries in which they can move,
right? So the bishop can only move
diagonally and there's a couple of
boundary conditions and I'm going to
create a reward function and I'm just
going to let the thing self-learn and
selfplay. That's his version.
And then what happens is when you map
out every single permutation
when you go and play Keith, who's the
best chess player in the world, what
you're doing at that point is saying,
"Okay, Keith made this move." So you
search for what Keith's move is, and you
have a distribution of the best moves
that you could make in response or vice
versa. That was the cutting edge
approach. The different approach which
is more, you know, what people would
think is more quote unquote elegant and
less brute force would be Jason for you
and I to sit there and say, "Okay, if
Keith moves here, we should do this. We
should do this specific variation of the
Sicilian defense." And
and it's too much human knowledge. And I
think what what it turned out was there
was a psychological need for humans to
believe we were part of the answer.
But what this is showing is because of
Moore's law and because of general
computation, it's just not necessary.
You just have to let go, give up
control. And that's very hard for some
people and for others.
It's also very hard in some
circumstances where a car is driving
down the road and it's learning in that
process, which is why you need a safety
driver. And and I think Elon made the
right decision to put one in there.
Keith, your thoughts?
Yeah, a a couple points. It's it's not
quite that binary. Chimoth, I generally
agree with your arc, but like if you
think about LLMs being the most
important unlock in AI, LLMs are all
trained on human writing. So someone
wrote every piece of data that every LLM
use a human wrote at some point in
history. So yes, it's true that they've
shocked everybody including OpenAI's,
you know, original team on the
implications, the broad implications,
the general applicability to almost
every problem, but it's not like there
was uh some tablets floating in space
that weren't drafted by humans that
we've trained on. as you get in non LLM
based uh models, you may be totally
right, but almost no one's really using
nonlm based models at scale
on driving specifically. Travis is
totally right that humans are actually
really good drivers except when they get
distracted. They get distracted by drugs
or alcohol. They get distracted by being
tired. They get distracted by turning
the radio. They get distracted by
chatting with their passenger. So
trading against human behaviors actually
turned out to be a great decision
because what for whatever sort of
Darwinistic reasons humans are pretty
ideal drivers and so you don't have to
reason from first principles this is a
much better path and I think again there
may be a a broad u sort of lesson there.
most important thing I think as a VC
that you said uh is we've been debating
for years should we invest in companies
like scale or mercore or any of these
surge the truth is I think there's a
very short halflife
on human label data and so everybody
who's investing in these companies just
looking at revenue traction
really didn't understand that there may
be a year two years three years max when
anybody uses human label data for maybe
anything
because we hit the end of human
knowledge or just the collection of it.
99% done
or you train on you train on it so well
that you don't need to label anymore.
Like the the machines know how to label
as good or better than a human. And so
like we're seeing this in the
self-driving space is labeling was huge,
right? You would have a
three-dimensional sort of scene that's
created by video plus LAR. Let's say,
okay, I have to label all of these
essentially what become boxes like I've
identified objects. You're you're some
of the players in the in the autonomous
software space, autonomous vehicle
software space are no longer doing any
labeling because the machines are doing
it all.
Just broadly,
it'll just be built into the chipset
that this is a stop sign. Like it's like
we know what a stop sign is. We don't
need the millionth time for somebody
captas like you're like find the stop
sign or what's the traffic light and
eventually the machines are just way
better than humans at identifying these
things
or you to be very practical when you see
a stop sign you don't have to identify
that it's a stop sign. You just see that
every human when they encounter a stop
sign 99.9% of the time they hit a break
and they never act. So nobody actually
knows it's a stop sign. It's just that
hit a break when you see something that
looks like this object.
It's just a vibe.
Yeah,
it's a vibe.
I would just say that that's like
intuitive knowledge versus like the
expressly labeled human knowledge. The
question for me is if everybody was so
reliant on human labeling initially, if
you're an investor now, when you see
these Gro four results,
how do you make an investment decision
that's not purely levered to just
computation?
So if you look at these results, does it
mean that the, you know, there's 300 to
a,000 basis points of lag
between just letting the computers vibe
itself to the answer versus interjecting
ourselves? If interjecting ourselves
slows us down by 300 to a,000 basis
points per successive iteration, then
over two or three iterations, you've
totally lost. So, what does it mean for
everybody that's not Grock when they
wake up today and they have to decide
how do I change my strategy or double
down?
I think look, I'm I'm not in the
investment game, but if I were, it would
be all about scientific breakthrough.
So, I sometimes get in this place where
I'm looking I'm going down a path. I,
you know, I'll be up at 4:00 or 5 in the
morning. Uh, my day hasn't quite
started, but I'm not sleeping anymore.
And I'll start go like I'll be on Kora
and see some cool quantum physics
question or something else I'm looking
into and I'll go down this thread with
GPT or Grock and I'll start to get to
the edge of what's known in quantum
physics and then I'm doing the
equivalent of vibe coding except it's
vibe physics
and we're approaching what's known and
I'm trying to poke and see if there's
breakthroughs to be had and I've gotten
pretty damn close to some interesting
breakthroughs just doing that.
And I, you know, I pinged uh I pinged
Elon at some point. I'm just like, dude,
if I'm if I'm doing this and I'm super
amateur hour physics enthusiast like
what about all those PhD students and
postocs that are super legit using this
tool and this is pre Grock 4 now with
Grock 4 like like there's a lot of
mistakes. I was seeing Grock make that
then I would correct and we would talk
about it. Grock could be this place
where breakthroughs are actually
happening, new breakthroughs. So if I'm
investing in this space, I would be
like,
who's got the edge on scientific
breakthroughs and and the application
layer on top of these foundational
models that orients that direction? Is
your perception that the LLMs are
actually starting to get to the
reasoning level that they'll come up
with a novel concept theory and have
that breakthrough or that we're kind of
reading into it and it's just trying
random stuffs at the at the margins.
It's uh
or maybe it doesn't happen.
No, no, no. So, what I what I've seen
and again I haven't used Grock for I
tried to use it early this morning but
for some reason I couldn't do it on my
on my app. But
so let's say we're talking Gro 3 and
existing chat GPT as it is. No, it
cannot come up with the new idea. These
things are so wedded to what is known
and they're so like even when I come up
with a new idea, I have to really it's
like pulling a donkey sort of. You see,
you're pulling it
because it doesn't want to break
conventional wisdom. It's like really
adhering to conventional wisdom. for
pulling it out and then eventually goes,
"Oh [ __ ] you got something."
But then when it says that, when it says
that, then you you have to you have to
go, "Okay, it said that, but I'm not
sure." Like you have to double and
triple check to make sure that you
really got something. To your point,
when these models are fully divorced
from having to learn on the known world
and instead can just learn
synthetically,
yeah,
then everything gets flipped upside down
to what is the best hypothesis you have
or what is the best question? You could
just give it some problem and it would
just figure it out.
So, where I go on this one, guys, is
it's all about scientific method,
right? If you get if you have an LLM or
foundational model of some kind that is
the best in the world at the scientific
method,
game the f over.
You basically you just light up more
GPUs and you just got like a thousand
more PhD students working for you.
Keith, you're nodding your head here.
I I agree with that. I think that's
fantastic because the scientific method
also the faster it is the more you when
you have a hypothesis the faster you get
a response you're more likely to dive in
and dive in and dive in recursively and
recursively and every lag every
millisecond lag causes you to like lose
your train of thought sort of so to
speak. So you get the benefits that
Travis alluding to plus speed and you go
places you never guess. This happens all
the time when you run a company and
you're doing like analytics and you have
a tool that allows you to constantly
query quickly quickly quickly double
click triple click you get to answers
that you never get to there's even a
second or two second or 3 second delay
let alone sending it to a human.
Secondly where you actually see this
today it's already happening. If you
look at foundational models that just
apply to science, there's lots of things
about the human body, let's say in
health biology, that we humans don't
actually understand all the connections.
Like why do we do X? Why do some people
get cancer? Why other people not get
cancer? Why does the brain work this
way? Models trained solely on science
tend to expose connections that no human
has ever had before.
And that's because like the raw
materials there and we only have a
conscious awareness of call it 110%. But
when you apply it to other human domains
where they're training on human sort of
data, human produced data, human
produced output, they're limited to that
output. So I think you just take the
science and apply it at large and you
you're going to wind up finding things
that no human has ever thought before.
And it's that the thing about science
though is that it's the hypothesis that
you then have to test in the physical
world. So the you're like okay you've
got this hive mind this like you know
this this
computation engine this brain of sorts
you wanted to say consciousness but you
start I was like how do I describe
the big C word consciousness
but but you need to be able to test in
the physical world so you could imagine
a a physical lab connected to one of
these systems
where then you could say, okay, like if
it was a chemistry experiment, you could
do chemistry experiments or physics. You
get the idea.
What could go wrong?
It would be it's yeah, no big deal. It's
going to be fine. Okay. So, but but this
is where it goes because if you have a
scientific method machine, you still
have to be able to test your hypothesis.
You have to go through the scientific
and the verification. Yeah. Exactly.
Yeah.
Wow. It's kind of mind-blowing. Reminds
me
really mindblowing
if you remember I don't know if you guys
remember dark matter and like the
discovery of it and everything and as
explained to me by Lisa Randall you know
the the discovery was made not by
knowing there was dark ma matter there
and observing it but observing there was
something you know gravitational forces
around this other matter and then they
said wait what's causing that and that's
why they found dark matter so these
ideas you know the idea that LLM could
actually do that
come up with something so novel is it
doesn't it feels like we might be right
there, right? Like we're kind of on the
cusp of it.
One of the seven most difficult problems
in math or the most important problems
in math is proving a general solution to
this thing called Mavier Stokes, which
is basically like viscous fluid dynamics
and conservation of mass. We use it
every day in the design of everything.
You know what? It hasn't been proved.
Isn't that the craziest thing where
you're just like, how is this even
possible? We use it to design airplanes,
to design everything. It hasn't been
proved. And so you could just point a
computer at this thing and you would
unlock all these incredible mysteries of
the universe and we would probably find
completely different propulsion systems.
We could probably do things that we
didn't think were possible.
Teleportation I mean who knows what's
possible.
But remember remember you know how Elon
talks about Brock and and about AI
generally is about why are we here? What
is the purpose?
Meaning of the universe. Yeah. What is
the meaning of the universe? How does it
work?
And a sort of fierce truth seeeking
mechanism there.
Let me ask you a question, Keith,
Travis, Jason. If you guys were running
Grock 4,
that'd be so much fun.
How do you judo flip open AAI? Because
they
are marching steadfastly towards a
billion Mao, then a billion DAO.
It's a juggernaut. So, how do you use
the better product in a moment to judo
flip
the less better product?
Look. Yeah. I mean, here's the thing,
right? So, you do the Elon way. So you
have you get a bunch of missionary like
full-on missionary engineers that work
twice as hard and you have a culture
that is ultra fierce truth seeeking
and you don't you don't get caught up in
politics, bureaucracy, BS
and you just you go for it and and I
think you know that's where you know and
then you go wow scientific breakthrough
scientific method method like you start
winning on truth and that will start I
believe that will start to give the
product awesomeness
of open AI a run for its money
but like the product of open AI the
product department those guys are
crushing
they're really good they're not only
ahead of the game but they feel like it
just they're just leading in a lot of
different ways but if you are better at
truth you will eventually you'll
eventually have an AI product manager.
Yeah. And on a technical basis too,
people forget how good Elon is at
factories and physical real world
things.
Uh what he did standing up Colossus made
like Jensen Juan was like how is this
possible that you did this right? So
pressing that his ability to build
factories and he said many times like
the factory is the product of Tesla.
It's not the cars that come out of the
factory or the batteries. It's the
factory itself. So if he can keep
solving the energy problem with solar on
one side and batteries and standing up,
you know, Colossus 2, three, four, five,
he's going to have a massive advantage
there on top of Travis, you know, the
missionary
individuals, which by the way was what
he backed before Sam Alman corrupted the
original missionary basis of OpenAI and
made it closed AI and a,
you know, this is nothing derogatory
towards him, but he did hoodwink and
stab Elon in the It's not nothing
personal. I mean, he just screwed him
over. And
would you say he bamboozled him?
He bamboozled him, screwed him,
hoodwinkedked him, you know, but pick
your term here. But, uh, he did he
didn't dirty. The original mission was
to be missionary and open source all
this content. That's the other piece I
think is a wild card. And I'll and then
I'll sing Keith's position, but
open sourcing some of this could have
profound ramifications. I think open
sourcing the self-driving data could
have a really profound impact.
Elon wanted to do something really
disruptive like he open sourced his
patents for you know um charging. If he
opens source the data set and
self-driving does anybody have the
ability to produce robo taxis at the
scale he can do it? I don't think so.
Travis's hypothesis is true then yeah
everybody will. Well, what? Sorry.
Everybody will what? Shiman,
if you have access to the money that
buys the compute, everyone could solve
that problem.
What's the hardware piece I'm talking
about?
He said he said if he if he published
all the FSD data, could somebody build
an autonomous vehicle?
Well, yes, but could somebody produce a
100 million robo taxis from a factory
with batteries in them?
Okay. No, that's a diff that's a
different question.
That's the thing I'm saying. And not
really because last time I was a guest
on you know on we talked about vertical
integration.
Uh products really require vertical
integration. So ultimately you have a
self-driving something that is
customuilt for knowing it's going to be
self-driving and it interacts
differently. The cost structure is
different. The controls are different.
The seating's different. everything. You
build a product taking advantage of
where in the stack you have the most
competitive advantage, but then you
leverage that and it reinforces it's
still why like Apple despite missing the
AI wave still a pretty good company from
any empirical standpoint. I mean like
the performance is absolutely miserable
on the most important technology
breakthrough of the last 70 years, but
the company's still alive and still
worth trillions of dollars because it's
vertically integrated. Open AAI at your
point, they do have a good product team
and they need to stay ahead on the
product level because they can't compete
on the factory level. The way to stay
ahead on the product level is shipping a
device. They got to ship the device.
It's got to be good. It's got to be
right. It's got to be the right form
factor. It's got to do things for humans
that are unexpected. But then if they do
that, they're like Apple plus AI.
Chimath, what's the paper you were
talking about before? What was the name
of it again?
The bitter lesson.
Yeah. could apply to autonomous driving
is right now it's still like hey how do
I drive like a human we talked about
that but the leapfrog moment here could
be like hey drive a car make sure it's
efficient don't hit anybody and just
simulate that uh quadrillion times and
it's all good right but right now we're
still trying to drive like humans
because we don't have enough data and
therefore can't do enough compute
that's the global lesson by the way
you're totally right conceptual you the
blog post is right. But that's only true
when you have enough data. And depending
upon the use case, the level of data you
need may not be possible for years,
decades, and you may need to hack your
way there through human interactions.
Yeah, physical world AI is lacking in
data and so you just try to approximate
humans.
I don't know if you guys have seen this.
In related news, OpenAI and uh
Perplexity are going after the browser.
Perplexity launch comet for their $200 a
month tier. I actually downloaded I'll
show it to you in a second. But this is
um a really interesting category. It's
something developers can do already and
they do it all the time, you know, but
having your browser uh connected to
agents let you do really interesting
things. I'll show you an example here
that I just fired off while we're
talking. So, I just asked it, hey, give
me the best flights from um United
Airlines and uh business class from New
York City, from San Francisco to New
York City. It does some searches, but
what you see here is it's popped up a
browser window and it's actually doing
that work and you can see the steps it's
using and then I can actually open that
browser window and watch it do that.
This is just a screenshot of it and it
will open multiple of these. So you
could I was doing a search the other day
saying like, "Hey, tell me all the
autobiographies I haven't bought on
Amazon. Put them into my, you know,
shopping cart and summarize each of them
cuz I like biographies and I like doing
it here." And when it did this last
time, it put my flight into
like uh and I was logged in under my
account and it basically put it into my
account in the checkout.
So again, this isn't like if you're a
developer, you do this all day long, but
this really seems to be a new product
category. I'm curious if you guys have
played with it yet. And then what your
thoughts are on having an agentic
browser like this available to you to be
doing these tasks
in real time. You can also connect
obviously your Gmail, your calendar to
it. So I did a a search, tell me every
restaurant I've been to and then put it
by city. And then I was going to open my
open table and then pull that data as
well. What's interesting about this,
Keith, and I know you're a product guy
and done a lot of product work. I'm
curious your thoughts on it is you don't
have to do this in the cloud. You're
authenticated already into a lot of your
accounts, nor do you have to worry about
being blocked by these services because
it doesn't look like a scraper or a bot.
It just it's your browser doing the
work. Your thoughts on this? Have you
played with it at Yep. I think it's a
great hail mary attempt by Perplexity. I
think up since something like this,
perplexity is toast. Like for the stat
about chat GBT is going to a billion
users like it's becoming the verb, you
know, that the way you describe using AI
for a normal consumer. There's nothing
left of perplexity if they can't pull
this off. So, it's a great idea because
like the history of like consumer
technology companies is whoever's up has
uphill ground like in a military sense,
whoever is first has a lot of control.
This is actually what Google should be
doing truthfully like I think Google's
also Google search qu search is toast
and since they have Chrome and they
theoretically have a quality team in
Gemini they should be putting these two
things together and hoping to compete
with Chad GBT they're going to lose the
search game like the assets that are
best at Google right now have nothing to
do with search it's every other product
is the only thing that's going to save
that company if they can put figure out
how to use them
Travis your thoughts on this category
anything come to mind for you in terms
of,
you know, feature sets that would be
extraordinary here? I know you you like
to think about products and the consumer
experience.
It's really interesting. So, you know,
I've been spending, as you guys know,
I've been spending my time on real
estate and construction and robotics.
And so, I' I've been out of the this
kind of consumer software game for a
long time. But super interesting over
the last six months there have been a a
number of consumer software CEOs
like when I hang out with them or
whatever they're like
yo how are we going to how are we going
to keep doing what we do when the agents
take over.
Yeah. The paradigm shift is so profound
that the idea that you would visit a web
page goes away and you're just in a chat
dial you have an agent that's just
taking care of your flights for you. So,
I I kind of I I think there's a leaprog
over that. I think
it's just like you tell something, yo, I
want to go to New York. Can you you
know, I'm sort of looking at this time
range. Can you just go find something
I'm probably going to like and give me a
couple options?
Yeah. And it's just a whole you have an
interface and then you know is perplex
is this thing that you just showed
perplexely is that the interface or do I
just have an agent that just goes and
does everything for me and is this the
start of that? I you know I just haven't
spent enough time. I I do know that
every consumer
software CEO
that has an app in the app store is
tripping. They're tripping right now.
And I mean big boys. I meet guys with
real stuff and sometimes I I'm doing
like almost like therapy sessions with
them. I'm like, "It's going to be fine.
You actually you actually have stuff.
You have a mo. You have real stuff
that's of value. They can't replace it
with an agent."
And they're like,
"So, you're lying to them. You're doing
hospice care and you're telling them
everything's going to be okay, but the
patient
options on Robin Hood while he's like,
"Yeah, yeah, tell me more. Tell me
more."
All these things.
There's certain things that are
protected and there's certain things
that aren't. That's all.
Well, let's talk about that because the
you and I are old enough to remember uh
general magic. This vision was out there
a long time ago with personal digital
assistance and you would just talk to an
agent. It would go do this for you. This
feels like a step to that where it does
all the work for you, presents you the
final moment and says approve.
Like a concierge or a butler. Yeah,
I think what you're describing is what
we want. But I think more specifically
for today, Keith and Travis totally nail
it. Look, I think building a browser is
an absolutely stupid capital allocation
decision. Just totally stupid and
unjustifiable in 2025. Specifically for
Perplexity,
I think their path to building a legacy
business is to replace Bloomberg.
Everything that they've done in
financial information and financial data
in going beyond the model has been
excellent. As somebody who's paid
$25,000 to Bloomberg for many years,
the terminal is atrocious. It's
terrible. It's not very good. It's very
limited.
and anybody that could build a better
product would take over a hundred
billion dollar enterprise because I
think it's there for the taking. I wish
that Perplexity would double and triple
down on that. And so when you see this
kind of
random sprawl,
let's do it, Jimoth. Let's just go do
it.
When you do the random sprawl, I think
it doesn't work. But I just want to say
like a browser is like the dumbest thing
to build in 2025 because in a world of
agents, what is a browser? It's a
glorified markup reader. It's like
handling HTML. It's handling CSS and
JavaScript. It's doing some networking.
It's doing some security. It's doing
some rendering. But it's like this is
all under the water type stuff. I get it
that we had to deal with all that
nonsense in
1998
to try LOS or Google for the first time.
But in 2025,
there's something that you just speak to
and eventually there's probably
something that's in your brain which you
just think and it just doesn't. You're
thinking
I need a flight to JFK or at the maximum
today in a very elegant beautiful search
bar you type in get me a flight and it
already knows what to do. Keith, in some
ways this is a step towards that
ultimate vision. So you'd think it's
worth it to you know sort of perplexity
to make this way point perhaps if you
look at it as a waypoint between the
ultimate vision which is a command line
and earpiece.
How do you get distribution Jason for
the 19th web browser in 2025? Well,
yeah, that is a challenge and I think
most people are speculating Apple, which
has a lot of users, might buy Perplexity
or do a deal with Perplexity and give
them that distribution because of the
Justice Department case against Google.
So, there's been a lot of speculation
about that. But Keith, what do you
think?
Well, I don't think they'd buy anything
worth it. Like, what do what is Apple
going to get if you continue this failed
strategy of Apple,
right? Apple has missed every possible
window on AI and continues to miss it
and it has cultural I think the CEO has
challenges I think culturally they have
challenges I think they have
infrastructure challenges so it's it's
not an easy fix but buying perplexity is
not going to help like strategy is
actually pretty coherent one for
perplexity qu perplexity uh so I think
that it's not
pick a vertical and own it strategy
not not a bad idea um especially because
you need unique data sources some of
those data sources may or may not
license their data to open AI. So, you
can do some clever things there, but um
I don't think there's any residual value
that Apple would get out of perplexity
except there's some product taste, but
what are you going to spend like a
billion dollars for product taste? I
mean, Mark's spending hundreds of
millions of dollar, hundreds of billions
of dollars or whatever he's spending
these days. And you know, Grock, if
anything, Grock for shows that Mark
really doesn't need to just spend money
to build a whole new team because
everything they've done in AI has also
missed the boat. Well, I mean, Keith,
the way you phrase it there almost makes
it worth it for Apple to throw a Hail
Mary, have a team with some taste
because that's how they tend to do
things is something that is elegant. And
why not just throw your search to it,
throw 10 billion at
a bunch of what's elegant would be if
there's a bunch of agents and just a
chat box.
Seeing a bunch of visual diarrhea is not
elegant.
It's lazy.
On our on our little Bloomberg clone,
I'll give you naming rights. So you can
call it that.
You like you like poly polyhapatia. So
hey, can somebody can somebody uh bring
up the polyhapatia?
You know what's so funny?
Rolls right off your tongue.
TK, listen. We were trying to do a
screen
of companies and it maxes out at five
companies on a specific type of screen
where you're like you're trying to
compare stock price to EBID and you're
like, okay, I can only choose five, I
guess. So which five should I choose?
Lefont was on right like two episodes
ago. He was like I can't pull this up.
It's limited to six companies.
Dude, you it's So what do people use
Bloomberg?
They use it for the messaging. Now like
my team has traded huge positions via
text message on Bloomberg. So there is
something very valuable there.
But the core usability and the core UI
of that company has not evolved.
I have my contribution
and Plexity is very good at that by the
way. It they they do a very good job.
I got a new domain name Travis. Let this
one just sink in here. This is my way to
weasle my way into the deal.
begin.com.
Begin.com.
You own that, don't you?
I do. I'm just a little I sniped some
good ones once in a while. I got
begin.com and I got annotated.com. Those
are my two little domains.
You're like You're like one of these old
people that show up at those show and
then
show and you're like, "Oh, I have this
thing that I bought 1845."
Guys, Jason Jason is Jason is the daddy
and GoDaddy. Okay. I'm your dad. I'm
your daddy.
That's what it is.
Who's your daddy? Hey, speaking of
daddy.
Let's go on to our next story.
Come on.
Is now the right time for a third party?
Elon seems to think so. Last week, he
announced that AXI would be creating a a
new political party. I'll let you decide
who daddy is in this one. uh he said
quote when it comes to bankrupting our
country with waste and graft we live in
a one party system not a democracy he's
not yet outlined a uh a platform for the
American party we talked about it here
last week I listed four core values
which seem to get a good reaction on X
fiscal responsibility doge sustainable
energy and dominance in that
manufacturing in the US which Elon has
done uh single-handedly here pronatalism
which I think is a passion project for
him and Shabbath you punched it out with
the fifth technological excellence
according to poly market 55% chance that
Elon registers the American party by the
end of the year and you know one thing I
was trying to figure out is just how
unpopular are these candidates
and uh these political parties this is a
very interesting chart that I think we
could have a a great conversation around
it turns out we used to love our
presidents if you look here from Kennedy
at 83% % his highest approval rating.
His lowest was 56%.
That was his lowest approval rating. So
he operated in a very high band. Look at
Bush 2 during after 9/11. 92% was his
peak. His lowest was 19, right? Wartime
president. But then you get to Trump
one, Biden, and Trump 2. Historically
low high approval. Their high watermark.
49 for Trump one, 63 for Biden, one of
one. and then 47 for Trump too and their
lowest 29 3140. So maybe it is time for
a third party candidate. Let's discuss
it boys.
I have no idea how to read this graph. I
have zero idea the worst.
I'm like what is happening here?
This is the worst formatted chart. This
is a confusing chart. But well, the
reason I'm putting it up is for debate.
So you should be saying thank you.
Yeah, we're debating that it's creating
debating. Why did you put it up? Here's
another one. Gallup pole. Americans
desire for a viable third party. 63% in
2023. So, it's it's bumping along an
alltime high.
Okay. I'm really concentrating on this
one.
Okay. Anyway, I'm going to stop there.
What's the gray?
I'm going to let you.
Okay. Okay. Got
the different presents during that time
period and how popular parties were.
Let's stop here. This is a good This is
a good place to stop.
Yeah. A couple points.
Yes. The idea of Elon creating a third
party is for any other human being like
absolutely absurd and ridiculous. Elon
has obviously done incredible things. So
dismissing anything he's touching is a
bad idea. However, I think the best
metaphor I've seen is it's a little bit
like Michael Jordan tried to play
baseball
and he became a replacement level
baseball player, which actually really
hard to do. By the way, Elon is probably
a replacement level politician. Um, he's
Michael Jordan for entrepreneurial
stuff, but the third party stuff is not
going to work. First of all, um there
that chart is misleading. It's a flaw of
average. Well, it's both badly designed
and it's a flaw of average politics.
Trump is incredibly popular among
Republicans. He actually has the highest
approval rate of any Republican ever
measured in recorded history. It's 95%.
Reagan was peaked out at 93%. It's just
Democrats don't like him, which is
perfectly fine. Being polarizing is is
an ingredient to being successful,
including with people on the show. Like
the point of accomplishing things in the
world is you don't really care what half
the world thinks. You need to make sure
that there's a lot of people who like
you and really approve and are
enthusiastic about what you do. And
Trump is about as popular with his party
as anybody's ever been ever. Period.
No exceptions. Secondly, um there's MAGA
has kind of already uh changed the
Republican party. Trump is sort of like
a third party takeover of the Republican
party. And so it's kind of already
happened and maybe you can do this every
20 years or 30 years. I don't think you
can have like this kind of
transformation on one party within a two
compressed period of time for a lot of
reasons. Third is um really smart
parties absorb the lesson of political
science. Unfortunately I studied
political science. I wasted kind of my
college years and instead of saying CS
and you know maybe then I'd be coding
stuff and doing physics like Travis. But
one thing I did learn is smart parties
absorb the best ideas of third parties.
So the oxygen is usually not there
because there's a Darwinistic evolution
of if you get traction on an idea, it's
really easy to conscript some of those
ideas and take away the momentum. No
third party candidate that's a true like
third party has won a Senate seat since
1970.
And that's actually Bill Buckley's
brother. So he had some name ID. The
other thing Elon I think is missing and
the proponents of what he's doing is
people vote not just for ideas, they
vote for people. It's a combination. The
product is what do you what do you
believe and who are you? And you can't
divorce the two. Trump is a person and
that generates a lot of enthusiasm and
it's one of the reasons why he has
challenges in midterms because he's not
on the ballot. His ideas may be on the
ballot but he is not specifically on the
ballot. So unless because Elon can't be
the figure head of the party, he
literally can't constitutionally.
You need a face that's a person, Obama,
a Clinton, like there's reasons why
people resonate.
Reagan
without that personality. Specific ideas
just are not going to galvanize the
American people.
Okay. So the counter to that and what
people believe he's going to try to do
is win a couple of seats in the House,
Travis. win maybe one or two Senate
seats if you were to do that. Those
things are pretty affordable to back.
Couple of million dollars for a House
race. Senate maybe$25 million. If Elon
puts, I don't know 250 million to work
every two years, which he I think he put
280 million to work on the last one. He
could kind of create the Joe Mansion
moment and uh he could build a caucus, a
platform.
Grover Norquist kind of pledge along
these lines. So, what do you think of
that? If he's not gonna create a viable
third party presidential candidate,
could he Travis pick off a couple of
Senate seats, pick off a couple of
congressional seats?
Okay. So, first I have this axiom that
I'm making up right now.
Okay.
Okay. It's called Elon is almost always
right.
Okay.
Okay. All right.
Elon was right about everything.
Seriously, let's just be real. And like
honestly the things he's upset about and
that he's riled up about especially when
you look at the deficit like man I am
right on board that train. Part one.
Part two.
We've never had somebody with this kind
of capital that can be a quote unquote
party boss outside of the system. Right.
And
there's a lot of people that agree with
the types of things he's saying and he
knows how to draw, you know, he Elon in
his own right kind of has a populous
vibe like he does his thing and he's
turned X into what it is and he's he's a
big part of X. And so I think it's the I
think it's great and honestly there's
there's the moves you can make on Senate
and House and just having a few folks
and then being you being levers then to
get the things you want done. That's
part one. And then part two of that is
the threat of that happening can make
good things happen separately even if it
doesn't go all the way.
I just love it. I'm I'm on the train.
Yeah. I'm I'm I'm in love with this role
for Elon more than picking a party
because he's picking a very specific
platform that I think resonates with
folks which is just balance the budget.
Don't put us in so much debt and let's
have some sustainable energy, you know,
job done. Great job.
The problem with that is like he's
actually wrong about the reason why we
have a deficit or debt.
It's not because we're undertaxed. It's
we're massively overspending. If we just
No, I think he believes we're
overspending. They should have been
supporting the last, you know, beautiful
bill because if you just held federal
spending to 2019 levels, so 2019 is not
like, you know, decades ago,
literally with our current tax revenues,
we would be in a surplus,
500 billion.
Yeah. So there all we need to do is cut
spending. Now I admit that
why didn't that happen with the big
beautiful bill?
So this is where details do matter. I
think there is a willingness and a you
know discipline problem on both parties
and I think maybe he can help fix that.
The second thing is that we have these
arcane rules particularly in the Senate
that you need 60 votes in many ways to
cut things except through very hacky
methods and that's a reality. So the
best thing truthfully he could do is
help get a Republican party to 60 votes
and then in then in theory he could be
absolutely furious if you didn't cut
back to 2019 levels. But it it's very
tricky. Or you can just overrule like
this. The filibuster is an artifact of
history and at some point some majority
leader is just going to say we're done
with the filibuster and just steamroll
through all the cuts at 50 or 51 votes
which you can do. There's no
constitutional right to a filibuster. It
is an artifact of centuries of American
history and at some point it's going to
go away. So maybe the time is now. Maybe
we should just fix everything now.
I think you're exactly right. I think
that the filibuster it's just a matter
of time. I think it's on borrowed time.
And I think in a world where it is on
borrowed time, Jason, I think your path
is probably the one that gives the
American party, if it does come into
existence, the most leverage, which is
if you control three to five independent
candidates, you gain substantial
leverage. I just want to take a step
back and just note something. I don't
know if you guys know this, but the only
reason we're even having this
conversation or this is even possible is
because in 2023,
the FEC, Federal Elections Commission,
they actually released guidance and they
changed a bunch of rules. And the big
change that they made then was it
allowed super PACs to do a lot more than
just run ads. Up until that point, all
you could do if you were a super PAC is
just basically run advertising,
television, and radio,
I guess, online as well. But what they
were allowed to do starting in 23 was
they were allowed to fund ground
operations. They were allowed to do
things like door knocking, phone
banking, you know, get out the vote. So,
in other words, what happened was a
super PAC became more like a full
campaign machine. And Trump showed the
blueprint of using a super PAC,
specifically his, to win the
presidential election.
So he was able to fund this massive
ground game. He built infrastructure
across the swing states. He was
obviously incredibly effective. And now
that playbook can actually be used by
other folks. And so to the extent that
Elon decides to use those changed FEC
rules, Jason, I think what you said is
the only path. But but I just I I just
wanted to double click on Keith's point
because it's so important. I do think
the filibuster is going to go away and
it is because the the arceness of these
rules having to do a reconciliation bill
and you know needing a supermajority
veto proof supermajority in and the
other case it just means that nothing
gets done and I think somebody will
eventually get impatient and just
steamroll this thing. We've never had so
many people say they feel politically
homeless as we did the last two cycles.
And that includes many people on this
podcast, people in our friend circle.
And I think just the idea that Elon
could create a platform that people
could opt into and support, just the
existence of that would make the other
two parties get their act together.
By the way, I think that's what we need
is a little bit of a stick there and a
carrot. Hey, if you don't control
spending, there's this third option. And
if Travis and I are in it, and Keith, I
know you'll never leave the Republican
party, but Shimoth, you know, you're
probably set where you're where you want
to be right now. But I can tell you, we
go through our top 10 20 list,
out of those 50% will join Elon's party.
Well, look, the other the other thing,
Jason, that that Keith said, which I
think is is really important is
if he were to run people, I think they
have to transcend politics and policy.
And I think they need to be straight up
bosses. People that have enormous name
recognition so that effectively what
you're voting is a name and not an
agenda. Equivalent to, I think, what
happened to Schwarzenegger when he ran.
He ran on an enormous amount of name
recognition in the great Davis recall.
He didn't run on the platform. I don't
think anybody should mention that.
JD Vance had this great book, captured
people's imagination. He's an incredible
speaker. He pisses off a third or
twothirds of the country depending on
where you are in the country, but you
can't ignore him. I think Elon can find
10 JD Vance type characters and back
them fairly easily. He is a magnet for
talent. People will line up. I have been
contacted by high-profile people. I was
actually thinking of running. Can you
put me in touch with Elon?
I was thinking more like actors and
sports stars, meaning
where they just come with their own
in-built distribution. Like I think you
almost have to to rank ex followers and
Instagram followers and do a join and
say, "Okay, these are do you know what I
mean?" Like I think it's like totally
different.
It's painful, guys. It's painful. Like
let's not get more celebrities as
politicians. Like let's get like people
who've led large large efforts, large
initiatives, complex things, you know,
ideally, but they still have to
communicate, right, Keith? They have to
be able to communicate on a podcast.
That's the new platform.
If they can't spend two hours, three
hours chopping it up on a podcast like
this or Joe Rogan,
you know, that's Camala's the reason she
couldn't even contend was because she
couldn't hang for two hours in an
intellectual discussion. If you can't
hang, you're out in today's political
arena.
It'll be interesting to see if he can
tune his algorithm for talent, which is
epic,
to tune for politics because it's a
slightly different audience, but if you
can tune the algorithm and quality, that
might work. I think you can win a few
House races. I think that's doable. I
don't think you can win a Senate race.
Well, there it is. Elon Keith doesn't
think you can win a Senate race, but he
thinks you win a couple congressional
ones. Thanks for giving him the
motivation, Keith. I appreciate it.
I'm sure he's the biggest mistake you've
ever made. He's not going to win, too.
People in the Republican party right now
are going, "Oh, no. Don't poke the
tiger." Uh, listen. Speaking of
That's how Trump got into politics, so I
don't want to be Obama here. Okay.
You just Obama, Elon, right? Yeah.
Congratulations.
All right. Listen, Scotas made a big
decision here. This is a really
important uh decision. Uh they've sided
with Trump for plans for federal
workforce rifts, reductions in workforce
for those of you who don't know.
As you know, Elon, Trump, they wanted
to, you know, downsize the three million
people who are federal employees. This
is just federal employees we're talking
about. We're not talking about military,
and we're not talking about state and
city. That's tens of millions of
additional people. If you remember,
Trump issued this executive order back
in February when we got in office
implementing the president's Doge
Workforce Optimization Initiative. and
he asked all the federal agencies, hey,
just prepare a riff for their
departments consistent with applicable
laws was part of this EO. Okay. In
April, the American Federation of
Government Employees, AFGE, sued the
Trump administration, saying the
president must consult Congress on
large-scale workforce changes. This is a
key debate because the Congress, as you
know, has power of the purse. They set
up the money, but the president and the
executive branch, they have to execute
on that. And that's what the key is
here. So they accuse Trump of violating
the separation of powers under the
Constitution Act. AFGE has 820,000
members. In May, a San Francisco based
federal judge sided with the unions,
blocking the executive order. The judge,
who was appointed by Clinton, said any
reduction in the federal workforce must
be authorized by Congress. This is a key
issue. And the White House submitted an
emergency appeal, yada yada. Eight of
nine Supreme Court justices sided with
the White House in overturning this
block. And so the reasoning, it's very
likely the White House will win the
argument of the executive order. They
have the right to prepare a riff. The
question is, can they actually execute
on that riff? And who has that power?
Chimoth, does the power reside with the
president to make large scale or, you
know, riffs or do they have to consult
Congress first? Your thoughts on this
issue?
It's an incredibly important ruling.
incredibly right.
I think President Trump should have
absolute leeway to decide how the people
that report to him act and do their job.
If you take a step back, Jason, there
are more than 2,000 federal agencies.
Employees plus contractors,
I think, number 3 million people. If you
put three million people into 2,00
agencies
and then you give them
very poor and outdated technology, which
unfortunately most of the government
operates on, what are you going to get?
You're going to get incredibly slow
processes.
You're going to get
a lot of checking and double-checking
and you're going to ultimately just get
a lot of regulations because they're
trying to do what they think is the
right job. So since 1993, what have we
seen? Regulations have gotten out of
control. It's like a 100,000 new rules
per some number of months. Like it's
just crazy. So eventually we all succumb
to an infinite number of rules that we
all end up violating and not even know
it.
So if the CEO of the United States,
President Trump, isn't allowed to fire
people, then all of that stuff just
compounds. So I think that this is a
really important
thing that just happened. It allows us
to now level set how big should the
government be? But more importantly, the
number of people
in the government are also the ones that
then direct downstream spend that make
net new rules. And if you can slow the
growth of that down, you're actually
doing a lot. In many ways,
I wish Elon had come in and created Doge
now.
Like, could you imagine if Doge was
created the day after this Supreme Court
ruling? It would have been a totally
different outcome, I think, because with
that Supreme Court ruling in hand, these
guys probably would have been like a hot
knife through butter,
Travis.
So, I I think it's a big deal.
Except that ruling doesn't happen
without Doge. That Doge caused that
ruling to occur.
True. Well, the EO did you could have
passed all that was all Doge style,
though. You know what I'm saying? It was
If they wasn't firing people, yeah, they
probably wouldn't felt the need to your
point, Travis, to actually file this.
But Travis, if you are living in the age
of AI efficiency right now, operations
of companies is changing dramatically.
Can you imagine telling somebody you you
can be CEO, but you can't change
personnel. That's the job. You get to be
CEO, but you just can't change the
players on the team. You can buy the
Knicks, but you can't change the coach.
No, you can grow. You just can't shrink
it.
It's like a It's like running a
unionized company, which actually does
exist. Are largeized companies where you
can't do any of these things,
right? Do do they still exist or are
they all gone?
They're going quickly.
Yeah, probably.
I think this just gets back to what what
is actually Congress authorizing when a
bill occurs. And there's certain things
that are specific and certain things
that aren't. And I don't I'm not sure
that in in a lot of these bills, it's
not very specific about exactly how many
people must be hired. And so if it's I'm
just doing the common man's sort of
approach to this, which is like if if
the law says you have to hire x number
of people, then that is what it is. If
the law says you here's some money to
spend, here are the ways in which to
spend it, but it's not specific about
how many people you hire, then that is
different.
Yeah. It should be outcome based. Hey,
here's the goal. Here's the the key
objectives, right?
Travis Travis is totally right. Like
there are there's a variety of different
laws, some with incredible
specificities, some with very broad
mandates. The Constitution clearly says
that all executive power resides in the
president of the United States. Period.
There's no exceptions there. However,
Congress does appropriate money and post
Watergate,
many people think Congress has the power
to force the president to spend the
money. And you can debate that. You can
debate it on a per statute basis. And
that will be more nuanced and that's
going to get litigated whether the
president can refuse to spend money that
Congress explicitly instructed him to
spend, sometimes called empowerment.
That's a very interesting intellectual
debate. This one's a little bit easier.
It'll get more complicated again like
this EO is only approved to allow for
the planning. I think the vote might be
closer. I think there's still a majority
on the Supreme Court for the actual
implementation, but it may not be 81
when there's a specific plan that
possibly navigate its way through the
courts again.
Yeah, it's super fascinating.
Yeah. I wonder if they're going to get
to the point where they're going to say
in every bill, you need to hire this
number of people to hit
I don't I don't know if they can. Like
that's where it gets borderline
unconstitutional. like where you
actually prescribe that the president in
the exercise of his constitutional
duties has to hire certain number of
people
that feels pretty precarious.
Well, I I I'm not sure, Keith. That's
just like they prescribe a whole bunch
of other things like you must you must
appropriate money for to this specific
institution to do this specific work.
But that's not an executive function.
Like if you said like the secretary of
state has to have x number of employees
doing something, the secretary of state
is your personal representative to
conduct foreign affairs on behalf of the
president of the United States. It gets
a little bit more messy as you translate
it to people um that the president
should I mean yes Congress does set you
know which people are subject to Senate
confirmation, what their salaries and
compensation bans are. So it's it's
never going to be fully binary where the
president can do whatever he wants and
it's never gonna I don't think it'll be
constitutional for Congress to mandate
and put all kinds of handcuffs on the
president.
Well, then you you also have performance
that comes in here. What if you look at
the Department of Education? You say
scores have gone down. We've spent this
money. We're not getting the results.
Therefore, these people are incompetent.
Therefore, I'm firing them for cause and
I'm going to hire new people. How are
you going to stop the executive from
doing that? There's been a bunch of
litigation, you know, in parallel to
this litigation about the president's
ability to fire people. And for the most
part, the Supreme Court's basically,
with maybe the exception of the Federal
Reserve chair, said that the president
can fire pretty much anybody he wants.
I mean, that's the way to go is like I
mean, I hate to be cut, but if the
results aren't there,
I think if they're presidential Yeah. If
they're a presidential appointee, the
president should be able to fire you at
will. Just like if you were a VP at one
of our companies, the CEO should be able
to fire you at will.
But what about Keith? If the whole
department sucks. Hey, you guys were
responsible for early education. You had
to put together a plan. The plan failed.
Everybody's fired. We're starting over.
Like, you should be allowed to do that.
How are we going to have an efficient
government?
Some of these departments were created
by congressional statute, like the
Department of Education in 1979. And
you're right, every single educational
stat has got worse in the United States
since the department was created. But
[ __ ] there is a law on the books that
says there shall be a department of
education. So you may have to repeal
that.
All right, listen. We're at an hour and
a half, gentlemen. Do you want to do the
FICO story or should we just wrap Jama?
And we got plenty of show here. It's a
great episode. Anything else you want?
I don't really have much to say on the
FICO story. I thought these other topics
were really good though.
Oh, we did great today. This is a great
panel. I'm so excited you guys are here.
Let me just ask you guys um any offduty
stuff that you can share with us with
the audience. Any recommendations?
Restaurants, hotels, trips,
movies you watch, books you read? Keith,
I know that you are an active guy. What
What's on your agenda this summer?
Anything interesting you can share with
the audience that you're consuming,
conspicuous or otherwise?
Well, I don't want to share any good
restaurants or hotels because
Oh, you're gayeping. your gatekeeping.
Come on, man. Give us Give us your
babysitter. Baby, it's like if you have
a babysitter, you're not going to tell
everybody who you're babysitter.
Yes. Can I get your nanny's email,
but there are there are things that are
what do you call it? No marginal cost
consumption like Netflix. So, for
example, um you know, this documentary
on Osama bin Laden is phenomenal. Like I
don't know if any of you have seen it.
It's brand new
and you know I I'm a student of this
stuff and I I thought you know I knew
the whole story and etc. Watch episode
one. Just start with episode one and it
just blew me away with new information,
new footage, just absolutely incredible
stuff. So highly highly recommend it.
What uh what was the big takeaway for
you so far? I don't know if there's any
like specific takeaway, but just like so
many parts of the story are
misunderstood and not really understood
and how various confluences of somewhat
random things lead to a very
catastrophic result, but it it's it's
like as um dramatic as the best movie,
but it's a full documentary and you will
learn things and absorb things. I I just
I've had friends while I've been
recommending it to friends and for a
story you think you know it's incredibly
revealing.
Okay, Travis, anything you got on your
plate there that you're enjoying a
restaurant, a dish?
I mean look, you know, I mean Jason, you
know, I go to Austin a lot.
Yes.
Like basically from March till October,
I do about 15 weekends in Austin. I have
a lakehouse.
Jason's hung out a couple times.
So I I love water skiing. That's my
whole thing. That's my like I just love
it. It's just my thing.
Very zen. Very zen.
Yeah. And it's lake it's I call it lake
life. So
lake
that's a thing. And then I recently this
is a little bit of like a side quest.
I recently purchased
the preeminent back engine.
XG.
XG. That's right.
It's uh acronym is it's extreme gamut
and so the preeminent engine so all the
pros rate themselves based on this
it was done it was built by this amazing
entrepreneur this guy Zavier who is just
a full-on sort of
ultra ultra I mean just what's the word
I'm looking for it's not a
like a savant essentially
but hasn't worked on it for many years
so I'm getting back into it and
love it
and making it like taking modern machine
learning sort of deep learning
techniques and like big compute and
saying can we push the game of back
gammon forward. So super exciting and
ultra training apps to get people up to
speed quickly. I played in my first back
gammon tournament and cashed
so that was pretty cool.
No, wait. Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.
All due respect, you know the founder of
Uber. You're very high profile. You go
to this back in is this like held at the

And like people would So I went in super
low pro, just did my thing, but
eventually was recognized, but I was not

melee that basically occurred. They're
like, "Oh, the owner XG. Travis is here.
Shimoth, I feel like we've got a window
here to do the all-in back gammon
high-end tournament.

back gamon set. If we could make like a
$10,000 one, Chimath, we could kill
turtles or white rhinos, all the animals
that, you know, um Freeberg's trying to
protect. Oh my god.
We could murder them and then make
that would be so great.
Yes. Like maybe the white could be, you
know, rhinos and then you could take
something else, elephant skin,
something, you know, just really tragic
and then eat the meat and make the the
the back set for you.
I love back and honestly like if I
wasn't attempting to be like expert
poker player,

wonderful hang.

us some of your money playing back?
